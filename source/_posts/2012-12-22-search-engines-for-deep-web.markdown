<p>The Deep Web (also called the Deepnet, the Invisible Web, the Undernet or the hidden Web) is World Wide Web content that is not part of the Surface Web, which is indexed by standard search engines. It represents a gargantuan part of the internet which is not accessible through regular searches via google or other search engines.</p>
 
<p>Searching on the Internet today can be compared to dragging a net across the surface of the ocean. While a great deal may be caught in the net, there is still a wealth of information that is deep, and therefore, missed. The reason is simple: Most of the Web’s information is buried far down on dynamically generated sites, and standard search engines never find it.</p>

<p>So How do we access or search info from deep web? Well there are few special search engines available which can give you some glimps of it, I would list a few of them below:</p>
