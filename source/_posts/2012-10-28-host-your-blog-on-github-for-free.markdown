I recently came across this article about github pages.
 
If you make a repo with name same as your <strong>username</strong> then the content of the repo is hosted as subdomain <strong>http://YOURUSERNAME.github.com</strong>
 
Read here: <a href="http://help.github.com/pages/">http://help.github.com/pages/</a>
 
So now you can host your blog at Github sub-domain for free and update via Git! cool! B-)
<!--more-->
But as Github will not really provide you a server running php, mysql, etc so the limitation is it has to be static, but no worries, <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">Jekyll-Bootstrap</a> comes to rescue here. Itâ€™s a static site generator which would generate the html for you and then you can push it to you blog via git. Bingo!
