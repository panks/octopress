phew..!! finally it gets over, the sleepless nights fighting with end-sems. Although reading one night before the exam is a big pain but still invariably this habit is noticed in almost all the engineering colleges and in almost all the students with the exception of only a few who make it to 9+ points as CGPA.

While I was wondering today about what i’m going to do in holidays as it’s gonna be long one (3 months), one friend of mine suggested a idea.
_Android App_
<!--more-->
Hey! that’s cool! isn’t it. Obviously Android is one of the coolest thing out there nowadays and developing for android at the end of first year of college seems a nice idea.. :)

The proposal was to develop and an app which will remind you of something, when you reach a particular  location. Like if you wanna fetch something from market when you go next time, you should be able to set a reminder in the app using map or some such thing so that when you visit the market next it will give you a notification about the stuff you wanna buy..
Cool..!! B-)
I too forget lots of stuff when I visit my grandma’s place down the streets and then I regret after coming back home. An app of such kind would be a lot helpful in lot many ways.

After googling for some 30 mins I got know a little more about the app, at least how we can put it formally ;) - Proximity Based Reminder App
I got to know about Google API for Android development. I guess I need to use eclipse as an IDE.
It’s goona be in JAVA with XML for app layout.

I bookmarked a few sites too:

<a href="http://marakana.com/training/android/">
http://marakana.com/training/android/</a><br>
<a href="http://www.androidtutorials.org/">
http://www.androidtutorials.org/</a><br>
and of course: <a href="http://developer.android.com/index.html">http://developer.android.com/index.html</a><br> (it has some very nice samples)

and a book: Professional Android development (You can get if from amazon here. I got a free pdf of it)

it’s kind of all set, need to give a start. Flying home day after. Will start from next week hopefully.
