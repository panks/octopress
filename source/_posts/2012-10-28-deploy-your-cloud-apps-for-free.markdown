If you want to host you webapp somewhere and test/present it for 
free, you can use the free service given by Heroku or Openshift by Red 
Hat.</p>
<p>Heroku – <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">www.heroku.com</a> – is a 
good place to get a free web host. It supports most of the web 
programming languages like Ruby, Node.js, Clojure, Java, Python, and 
Scala. If you need database you get a 5 MB database for free. You just 
need to push your app to your server via git to deploy it.</p>

You would also learn how to use git (a version control software) to 
be able to deploy your application on heroku. For the first timers, it 
would take some time to get your application running on heroku. Once you are done, you will have a <a href="">http://&lt;some_arbitrary_name_if_you_have_not_specified&gt;.herokuapp.com</a> kind of url to access your application.</p>

<p>OpenShift – <a href="http://openshift.redhat.com/">www.openshift.redhat.com</a> is a similar (free) service . Choose the express option at <a href="https://openshift.redhat.com/app/platform">https://openshift.redhat.com/app/platform</a> to get started. It follows similar strategy as that of heroku.</p>
