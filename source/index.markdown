<h2>About Pankaj</h2>
---

I fill the days mostly lost in my own world pondering about the purpose of life, universe and everything, killing time doing not-so-urgent things, doing some research on [lucid dreams](https://www.quora.com/Lucid-Dreaming), [human body hacks](https://www.quora.com/Human-Anatomy), trying to contact intelligent life form from Canis Major Dwarf, and you would have got the idean by now. And with the other small time in hand I fix minor bugs in some opensource s/w I like, make some love with my bed and, slog through college work. Currently pursuing Computer Science Engg. from [IIT Madras](http://www.iitm.ac.in) in full Zzzz..mode. As a paragraph never does much justice to anyone, <a href="http://panks.me/blog">look around</a> to learn more. And yeah [Linkin Park](http://www.linkinpark.com) rocks.
